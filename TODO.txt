[x] Add an audio player element that plays something in loop
    [x] should let you play/pause
    [x] nice-to-have: ideally, control the volume
    [x] nice-to-have: ideally, display the time and have a cursor to skip?
[x] Add a button that applies / unapplies an equalization array
    - the equalization array will look like: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -12, 0, -12, 0, 12]
[x] Let user upload the audio file
[x] Clean UI: hide the option to upload audio file by default
[x] Add a quiz for the correct equalization
[x] Add an option to generate a new equalization
[x] Let user select between a few presets
    [x] figure out how to show a preset with licensing
    [x] show the options for user, have a White Noise preset
[x] Make it work in mobile (Firefox and Chrome on Linux)
[x] Add a README w/ links and stuffz
[x] Display an score
    [ ] reset the score when we change the audio
[ ] UI fix: add a "You're listening to ____" (the original/the EQ-version/your answer)
[ ] UI bug: sometimes it shows up the "no change" twice
[ ] Make sure it works in Safari
[ ] Save answers score locally, so that we don't lose it on refresh
[ ] Design beginner modes
    - need to think about this, one idea is to group the handles (will need
      to handle clipping)
    - another idea is to add an equalizer just for exploring with it
[ ] Design advanced modes
    [ ] mode "fix the equalization so that it matches the original"
    [ ] mode "identify which knobs were pushed"
[ ] Consider displaying the waveform with wavesurfer-js (is this actually useful?)
